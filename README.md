# BlockVCS

A blockchain-native version control system that stores code and version history directly on-chain, with support for cross-chain deployments.

## Vision

BlockVCS aims to revolutionize version control by leveraging blockchain's immutability and decentralization. The system stores code and history directly on-chain, prioritizing true decentralization.

### Core Features

- Native on-chain storage with efficient compression
- Cross-chain support (Solana, EVM, Bitcoin)
- Enterprise-grade access control and auditing
- Git-compatible workflows

## Development Status

Currently in early development phase:
- Building core blockchain storage
- Implementing Solana programs
- Developing client tooling

More details coming soon.
